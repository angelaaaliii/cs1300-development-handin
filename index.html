          As part of the research process, we complete a 
          competitive analysis to understand how other
          organizations are designing their aggregator and sorting/filtering 
          functions.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          To start, I selected 3 different websites with favoriting functions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram:</a>
              <br>
                  <img class="pic" src="./assets/instagram.png" 
                  alt="instagram's like functionality"/>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify:</a>
              <br>
                  <img class="pic" src="./assets/spotify.png" 
                  alt="spotify's liked songs functionality"/>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon:</a>
             <br>
                  <img class="pic" src="./assets/amazon.png" 
                  alt="amazon's favoriting (save for later) functionality"/>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, considering 5 factors:
          <ol>
            <li>Ability to sort by date added</li>
            <li>Ability to sort items alphabetically</li>
            <li>Ability to filter by content type</li>
            <li>Filter/sort modal utilized</li>
            <li>Filter/sort dropdown utilized</li>
          </ol>
          I conducted a competitive analysis with the 5 factors across 
          the 3 chosen websites.
        </p>

        <p>The table below displays the results:</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Amazon</th>
            <th>Spotify</th>
            <th>Instagram</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sort by date added: </td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sort alphabetically: </td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>no</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Filter by content type: </td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Filter/sort modal: </td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Filter/sort dropdown: </td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          <br>
          <br>After conducting the competitive analysis, I found that Instagram's filter/sort 
          modal was least successful because it decreased the user's flow and efficiency
          by having to navigate away from the favorites list. Along the same 
          reasoning, that also explains why the filter/sort dropdown that Spotify
          employed was one of the most successful. 
          <br>
          Another very successful 
          filtering method involved categorical filtering. Amazon utilized 
          filtering based on type of item and Spotify utilized categorical filtering 
          based on the type of genre. This allows the user to focus on what they are looking for 
          and reduce irrelevant items displayed. 
          <br> I noticed that sorting alphabetically 
          was only useful for Spotify song titles, which makes sense since these liked songs 
          have official song titles, whereas cart items in Amazon or posts on Instagram 
          don't have titles to alphabetically sort. 
          <br>Sorting by date 
          also was only useful for Spotify and Instagram because 
          their favorited items accumulate; however for cart items like Amazon, 
          the purpose is to eventually move items from the save for later cart to checkout, 
          so there is no real purpose to sort items saved for later by date added.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <br>
          Based on these observations and since I am implementing a shopping cart style aggregator, 
          I will not utilize a sort by date functionality. Similar to Spotify songs, since books have 
          proper titles they are referenced by, sorting by titles alphabetically would be successful. 
          I would also like to implement filtering on authors because consumers tend to find their 
          next book based on an author they already like. Lastly, since categorical filtering on content type was 
          successful I would like to implement filtering based on book genre.

        <h2>Final Site (Bookstore)</h2>
        <p>
          The final site developed was a bookstore with a shopping cart for users to add to before checking out. 
          <br>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key elements include 3 options at the top to sort by titles alphabetically, filter by author, and/or filter by genre.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All 3 filters/sorting features can be used together and if any of these dropdown menus are 
                set back to their default state, the filter/sorting will reset. </li>
                <li>I decided a reset button would be frusturating for the user if they want to control which filters/sorting to reset & 
                  having a reset button for each filter/sort functionality would be crowded and overcomplicated for the user
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Each book item displayed features the title first, then author, price, genre, and an add to cart button.</li>
            <li>Multiple copies of the same book can be added to the cart.</li>
            <li>The cart is at the bottom of the page and displays the total price based on the books in the cart.</li>
            <li>Each title in the cart is next to a remove button that will remove 1 copy of the book from the cart.</li>
            <li>This way users can control if they want to remove all copies of a book or just one copy of a book from the cart.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          To conclude, conducting a competitive analysis really helped when brainstorming functionality 
          to include in my own bookstore website. Looking at different sites with similar features allowed me to 
          get a better idea of what decision choices were successful and unsuccessful. 
        </p>
        <p>After examining sorting, filtering, and aggregating on Amazon, Instagram, and Spotify, the final 
          bookstore website was able to combine successful aspects from all 3 sites!
